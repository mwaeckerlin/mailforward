# Image contract: every shipped image must be headless.
#
# A production image must contain nothing that lets an attacker who reaches
# code execution pivot: no shell, no perl, no busybox. The image ships the
# service binary, its libraries and its configuration — nothing else.
#
# The check runs the interpreter as the container entrypoint instead of asking
# the image to look at its own filesystem: a headless image has no `ls` either,
# so a missing tool must be detected from outside. `--pull=never` keeps docker
# from silently pulling a stale image from the registry when the local build is
# missing; that would test the wrong artefact.
#
# Usage: tests/image-contract.sh IMAGE...
